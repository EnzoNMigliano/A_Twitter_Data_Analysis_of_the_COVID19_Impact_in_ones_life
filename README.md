A Twitter Data Analysis of the COVID-19 Impact in One's Life ü¶†
</p>
</h1>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the broad research question: <code> **What are the impacts of COVID-19 in one's life?** </code> Our team collected Twitter data to answer research hypothesis, producing models, and have a better understanding of the factors that influence one's reaction to the global pandemic. Our team collected more than 300 thousand tweets raging from 2009 to November of 2020. We utilized the open source software R [1] and the Rstudio [2] in order to gather the tweets and perform the different statistical analysis. We also utilized Git [3] and GitHub [4] to organize and share our project with the community. If you wish to check the coding behind all the statistical models and ohter relavant topics of the project, please access the folder named "Scripts". If you wish to have access to the graphs genarated throughout our project, please acess the folder named "Images".

 # The Present Study
 ## Statistical Analysis 
 Among the several supervisionated and unsupervisionated statistical models the most frequent ones in the present project were:
 
 - Decision Trees
 
 - Association Rules
 
 - Time Series
 
 - Sentiment Analysis
 
 <br/> 
 
 ## Research Questions
&nbsp; &nbsp; Covid-19 impacted the life of many, as several people got infect with the disease or even passed away. The scope of the consequences that pandemic brought to society is huge, therefore, the present project approached, under the theme Covid-19 impact in one's life, three major research questions:
  
  
### :heavy_check_mark: How Covid-19 impacted the people who were infected and/or tested positive for the disease?


 <br/>

### :hospital: How Covid-19 impacted the front line workers
 
 <br/>

### Sentment Analysis
### Method 

 <br/>

### Front Line Workers Tweets Before 2020

### Front Line workers Tweets During the First Half of 2020


###  Front Line workers Tweets During the Second Half of 2020



### Results

#### Comparison between before 2020 and the first half of 2020

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **trust throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly higher than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **surprise throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly higher than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **joy throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly higher than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **fear throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly lower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **anger throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly lower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **sadness throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantlylower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **negative emotions throught the tweets in the first half of 2020  was significantly lower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited **positive emotions throught the tweets in the first half of 2020  was significantly higher than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**


#### Comparison between before 2020 and the second half of 2020

- The proportion of front line workers that transmited trust throught the tweets in the first half of 2020  was

#### Comparison between the first and the seconf half of 2020
