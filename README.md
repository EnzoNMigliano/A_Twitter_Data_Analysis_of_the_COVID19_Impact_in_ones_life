A Twitter Data Analysis of the COVID-19 Impact in One's Life ü¶†
</p>
</h1>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the broad research question: <code> **What are the impacts of COVID-19 in one's life?** </code> Our team collected Twitter data to answer research hypothesis, producing models, and have a better understanding of the factors that influence one's reaction to the global pandemic. Our team collected more than 300 thousand tweets ranging from 2009 to November of 2020. We utilized the open source software R [1] and the Rstudio [2] in order to gather the tweets and perform the different statistical analysis. We also utilized Git [3] and GitHub [4] to organize and share our project with the community. If you wish to check the coding behind all the statistical models and ohter relavant topics of the project, please access the folder named "Scripts". If you wish to have access to the graphs generated throughout our project, please acess the folder named "Images".

 # Motivations & Past Research
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; COVID has affected every aspect of our lives, the way we gather, work, communicate, relate, and live. Even though we are seeing some improvements and we are slowly starting to see things go back to normal this pandemic has definitely taken a toll on everyone's physical and mental health. 
  
  ### Motivation
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Our motivation for this Project is to understand how people are currently feeling around COVID and what's their state of mind during the pandemic, in specific for the front line workers, people who tested positive for COVID-19, and people's affects towards the vacine.  
  
  ### Past Research 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the fact that the pandemic is fairly recent in our society, some research has been done in regards of the impact of COVID-19 in people's lives. The pandemic has been analyzed, however, in a large spectrun, in other words, in many studies the COVID-19 overral effect in society was the main porpuse. The results of such studies are great to understand the impact of COVID-19 as a whole, for  example, according to Chakraborty et al.[29] people majorly tweeted positive messages regarding COVID-19, but re-tweeted the negative tweets.

 # The Present Study
 ## Statistical Analysis 
 Among the several supervisionated and unsupervisionated statistical models the most frequent ones in the present project were:
 
 - Decision Trees
 
 - Association Rules
 
 - Time Series
 
 - Sentiment Analysis
 
 <br/> 
 
 ## Research Questions
&nbsp; &nbsp; Covid-19 impacted the life of many, as several people got infected with the disease or even passed away. The scope of the consequences that pandemic brought to society is huge, therefore, the present project approached, under the theme Covid-19 impact in one's life, three major research questions:
  
  
### :heavy_check_mark: How Covid-19 impacted the people who were infected and/or tested positive for the disease?
&nbsp; &nbsp; Covid-19 has been trending topic in all information and social platforms for the past year. Human interaction has been reduced to a minimum and people have turned to social media to account for their daily activities and to fill the void social distancing has cause. ‚ÄúI have Covid-19.‚Äù ‚ÄúI got symptoms.‚Äù ‚ÄúI test positive.‚Äù These are words no one wishes to express to a loved one, however, they have become more and more common since the pandemic began. The objective of the search queries was to identify among Twitter users those instances in which the users informed in social media that they had Covid-19 symptoms or had positive Covid-19 diagnosis. 

### The Sentimental Analysis 
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exploring some principal phrases like ‚ÄúI have Covid-19.‚Äù ‚ÄúI got symptoms.‚Äù ‚ÄúI test positive‚Äù We found that the phrases where mentioned with the wide range of instances like 5,429 for ‚ÄúI have Covid‚Äù, 1,067 for ‚ÄúI test Positive‚Äù and just 316 for ‚ÄúI got Symptoms‚Äù.
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our process to understand the phrases or the words we made a histogram for the most common word uses and covid it is mentioned in the tweets text 6,495 for 6,443 tweets downloaded. The ‚Äútested word we can see just 1,2009 in second rank follow by ‚Äúpositive‚Äù with 1,062 times used.

The following visualization is to see how the word ‚Äòcovid‚Äô is use in relation to other words.

### Cluster
&nbsp; &nbsp;For the cluster analysis I select the variables that work for the model. The cluster is important for the data analysis, is the job of grouping variables or attributes in the same group that represent the same hierarchical clustering. 
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Elbow method is to define clusters and the cluster inside variation. The following K-mean cluster indicate that two cluster is the distribution for this data for ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù and ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù.
<img src ="https://github.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/blob/main/Images/KmeansPicture8.jpg">

The first data show that the within cluster sum of sum squares is 59.2%. The following visualization is for the Kmeans Cluster Followers and Favorites for tweets.

The second cluster annalisys data show that the within cluster sum of sum squares is 53.2%. The following visualization is for the Kmeans Cluster Followers and Friends for tweets.
<img src ="https://github.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/blob/main/Images/TweetsPicture12.jpg">

### Cluster of test/word from the tweeter
&nbsp; &nbsp;Not enough with the tweets I decide to build a cluster test word for the text tweets and the result was that the ‚Äòcovid ‚Äò as a principal selection it‚Äôs connect with two other ‚Äúpositive , test‚Äù and ‚Äúmask and wear‚Äù. We can appreciate this in the Hierarchical word/tweeter clustering using dendrogram.

### Plot Frequent term

<img src = "https://github.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/blob/main/Images/ClusterDendogramPicture14.jpg">
Using dendrogram cluster the algorithm indicates that the within cluster sum square by cluster is 26.4%.

### Logistic Model
&nbsp; &nbsp;For the logistic Model we prepare the variable source from the tweets and we classify the in two groups ‚ÄòMobile‚Äô and ‚ÄòWeb app‚Äô. The dependent variables were ‚Äòsource‚Äô and the other variables like ‚Äòdisplay width‚Äô, ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô, ‚Äòfriends‚Äô, ‚Äòlisted‚Äô, ‚Äòstatuses‚Äô and ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô.  The model shows that the interaction with display text width, the listed count and the status count are the only variables that represent significant differences. 

glm(formula = source ~ ., family = binomial, data = train_lgtweets)

### :hospital: How Covid-19 impacted the front line workers
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our Team collected a sample of 993 tweets in the month of October of 2020. The Tweets were gathered using the following expressions, contained in the following R code, as search querries: <code> **testingFilter <- search_tweets(q = "\"I am a nurse\" OR \"I am a doctor\" OR \"I am a caregiver\" OR \"I am a nursing home caregiver\" OR \"I am a nursing home worker\" OR \"I work at a hospital\" OR \"I work at a nursing home\" OR \"I work at the medical field\" AND -filter:verified",
  n = 10, include_rts = FALSE)**</code>. The objective of the search querries was to find the Twitter users that are front line workers. Thereafter, we extracted the timelines of those users up to 400 tweets back in time. Both datasets, the initial search querry and the data set with all the timelines were the base for most of the analysis about the impact of Covid in the frontline workers. If you wish to see the source code for the data colection access the "Scripts" folder in the GitHub page, the initial search that resulted from the search querry is listed in the folder called "Data". 
  
 **Here are some sample tweets from the original 993 tweets extracted from the front line workers:** 
  
> "@MileyCyrus @CashApp $lissamc1123 **I work at a nursing home** and it‚Äôs so **hard during covid**, we‚Äôve been in **lockdown for almost 9 months**, I‚Äôm getting so **burnt out** and this would mean so muchüñ§ https://t.co/ZV7Q14rqfZ"
>



> "@IlluminatiEyes **I am a nurse who left the ICU** four years ago to get away from the stress. I am **back working in ICU due to covid**. So far we have had to create an additional 20 ICU beds, rent equipment, and pull staff from other areas. These are the **sickest patients that I have seen in almost 20 y**""
>



> "**I am grateful** for Mrs Ruth Khoza and Dr Thulani Khoza of #Ulundi , South Africa for paying my registration fee to #medicalschool. **I am forever #grateful**. Today **I am a doctor** because they planted a seed, **they believed in me**. **Believe in someone**, \n\nhttps://t.co/EAlvQbFO5p"
>



> "‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§\n\n**I am a nurse and educator**. These times have been hard for everyone. For me, I worry for those who are ill and those who are not. Will we be able to **keep ppl  healthy?** Will we be able to care for them all?\n\n**I am SO proud** we have a leader who cares about people's lives. üôèüèº https://t.co/J3fnVamXpB"

### Time Series Analysis and Non-Linear Regression
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to show how relevent Twiiter is as a platform for the front line workers to express themselves, in special during the pandemic, our team developed a time series analysis for the tweets that we gathered. The first time series analysis was about the ammount of tweets tweeeted, starting from the oldest tweet we gathered up to the newest one. Followed by a forecast for the next 6 months. 

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/main/Images/Time%20series%20tweets%20dec.jpeg">

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/main/Images/Time%20series%20tweets%20pred.jpeg">


&nbsp; &nbsp; This time series analysis is even more insightful than the previous ones. The time series takes into account the number of accounts created over the time. Followed by a forecast of the next 6 months. As we can observe in the year of 2020 there was a boom of accounts created among the front line workers.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnzoNMigliano/A_Twitter_Data_Analysis_of_the_COVID19_Impact_in_ones_life/main/Images/Time%20series%20accounts%20pred.jpeg">



&nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly, our team performed a non linear regression to predict the cumulative number of tweets given the cumulative number of accounts. The graph demonstrate the exponential relationship between the cumulative number of accounts created and the cumulative number of tweets.

 <br/>
 
### Sentment Analysis
### Method 
&nbsp; &nbsp; In other to interpret what the front line workers were saying in their tweets, our team utilized codes to remove punctuation, stop words of the english language(e.g., the), get the word stream (e.g., workers, working and worked were transformed in work), and to transform all the words in lowercase so the analysis could be done in the general idea rather than the specific message of the tweet. Also, after performing all the transformations in the tweets, our team utilized the 
NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon from the package syuzhet[18]. The package utilizes a crowdsource dictionary were people assigned several thousands of words to different feelings and emotions. The package utilizes those classifed words as references and classify the words from the tweets to the following categories:


| Sentiment | Emotion | Emotion | Emotion | Emotion |
| --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
| Positive | Trust | Joy | Antecipation | Surprise | 
| Negative | Sadness | Disgust | Anger | fear |

### Results
&nbsp; &nbsp; In other to analyse if there significant changes in how the front line expressed themselves in Twitter, our team peerformed a serie of proportion tests.
#### Comparison between before 2020 and the first half of 2020

- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **trust, surprise, joy and positive emotions throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly higher than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**


- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **fear, anger, sadness, and negative throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly lower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**


#### Comparison between before 2020 and the second half of 2020

- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **trust, surprise, anger, and positive throught the tweets in the second half 2020 was significant higher than the tweets before 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **fear, disgust, sadness, and joy throught the tweets in the first half of 2020 was significantly lower than before 2020 (p < 0.001)**


#### Comparison between the first and the second half of 2020

- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **disgust, surprise, anger, and sadness throught the tweets in the of the second half 2020 was significant higher than the tweets first half of 2020 (p < 0.001)**

- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **trust, joy, surprise, antecipation, negative, and positive throught the tweets in the second half of 2020 was significant lower than the tweets of first half of 2020 (p < 0.001)**


 <br/>

#### Comparisons within a period

##### Negative vs Positive
- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **negative sentiments throught the tweets was significantly lower than positive sentiments in all periods(p < 0.001)**


##### Sadness vs Joy
- The proportion of front line workers that transmitted **sadness throught the tweets was significantly lower than joy sentiments in all periods(p < 0.001)**


 <br/>
 
### Association Rules
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our team not only interested in the sentiments that would be transmitted through the Twitter from the front line workers, but also interested in the words that the front line workers would speak, in specific in the context of mentioning themselves. Therefore, in other to perform the association rules, our team utilized the first data set of 993 observations were the Twitter users clearly stated that they were front line workers. The following graphs are ordered respectively by the 5, 10 and 20 words with the most expressive lifts. Our team utilized as threshold <code>*0.01 of aupport and 0.5 of confidence that resulted in more than 200000 association rules*</code>

### :syringe: What are the expectations of the Covid-19 vaccine?

- To create a sentiment analysis, we retrieved the emotions that were related to the COVID vaccine. We retrieved more than 18,000 tweets that included the word vaccine and #vaccine in the text. We later made a count of these words in each of the tweet phrases:

- anger
-anticipation
- disgust
- fear
- joy
-sadness
- surprise
- fear
- joy
- sadness
- surprise
- trust

We assigned a 1 to each time the tweet mentioned any of these words and at the end substracted the negative words from the positive words to understand if the overall sentiment of the tweet was positive or negative. We'll call this analysis "Vaccine Analysis 1"

Also, we conducted a different type of analysis ("Vaccine Analysis 2") where we found the tweets that were Semantic Differencial Adjectives (Opposites from each Other) 
- Semantic Differential Adjectives:

- Excited vs Scared

- Happy vs mad

- Good vs Bad

- Safe vs Dangerous 

- Hopeful vs Hesitant

### Sentiment Analysis 

### Vaccine Analysis 1

In the following graphs, you can see visualizations for "Vaccine Analysis 1". You can see the sentences that include these words in their tweets.

### Naive Bayes Model

- We conducted a Naive Bayes Model to see if given the user feelings, will the tweet have a positive negative sentiment?

- The accurracy of this model was 0.5

### Non Linear Regression (Loess Method)

## Conclusion
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are more positive feelings related to the vaccine, the predominant feeling is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù followed by ‚Äúhopeful‚Äù and ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. The predominant negative feelings are ‚Äúscared‚Äù, ‚Äúmad‚Äù, ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù. Moreover, Twitter has become a relevant platform for the front line workers express themselves. As we saw the front line workers, despite all challenges, remained with a positive attitude, or better yet, with a positive attitude significantly higher than before. Therefore, lets respect the front line workers resiliency and do one of the major requests in the their tweets ‚ÄúWear -> Mask‚Äù. Finally, COVID-19 is a serious issue, even for those who are not in risk group, as we saw people who got COVID-19 also tweeted that they were feeling sick and had symptoms. Moreover, another word tweeted with COVID-19 was home, and therefore shows another challenge for those who tested positive: A complete social isolation for a period of 14 days. In conclusion, COVID-19 is a complex issue with the most diverse impacts in society, but its individual impacts are more salient for those who were directly exposed to the virus in the most diverse situations. There is hope, however, with the vaccines and the overall positive sentment of the population regarding the vaccines.
